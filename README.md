# Automatic Transmission

By default, if you shift+click something that should generate a chat hyperlink, like an item, but your chat edit box isn't active, nothing happens.

With Automatic Transmission, you don't have to remember to focus the chat edit box first - it will default to pasting to your last-used edit box.
